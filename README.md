## Who pays

- receiving foodbank
- ordering food bank

### Suggestions from Mr. Weible:
(Office hour Dec 1)
- The receiving foodbank pays for transportation
- The economic utility function may or may not be valid. Also make intuitive statistics, e.g. the proportion of clients\
who get no food at all
- Compare the setting of sharing food between foodbanks v.s no sharing
- The simulation doesn't need to be too complicated.
