# Food Bank Network Simulation

## Unit Food Bank Simulation
To test that our simulation is working at the Food Bank level, measured daily average utility.
In the following plot, it we observe that average utility stabilizes at around .25, which is the value we expect:

The dips in utility are also reasonable, as they represend days when pantries are not held.

Furthermore, when a food bank is provided with excessive amounts of donations, we have that utility is much higher, reaching around .32 (out of .4):

### Who pays

- receiving foodbank
- ordering food bank

#### Suggestions from Mr. Weible:
(Office hour Dec 1)
- The receiving foodbank pays for transportation
- The economic utility function may or may not be valid. Also make intuitive statistics, e.g. the proportion of clients\
who get no food at all
- Compare the setting of sharing food between foodbanks v.s no sharing
- The simulation doesn't need to be too complicated.
